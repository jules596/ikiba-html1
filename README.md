    <h1>An insider's Guide to JIO</h1>
   <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.<br>
     <italic>I know it was'nt what you were expecting</italic>
    </p>
    <h3>This is it I Promise!</h3>
    <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like Lagos metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful ta kua bay beach, I like the . I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.

    <h2>Educational Background and interest...</h2>
    <p>
     I always wanted to be Educated, I liked reading but onlu read a few books the one i loved the must was "The Alchemist" by Paulo. He has influenced millions of people through his books. I also wanted to be a great Doctor while growing up , like by cousin Joseph Okiti, who is a surgon. Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some learning, some research, some writing, and Coding. But my dream is still alive and getting bigger everyday!.
